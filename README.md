# Browser Use Desktop

<img width="1456" height="484" alt="desktop-app-banner" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550ca16a-5a61-4ded-92f0-a30421870223" />

## A desktop app for running browser agents. 

Running automations on your local Chrome interferes with your daily work and also requires permissions every time. Instead, you can port your cookies into a new Chromium environment and run tasks there. 

With a separate desktop app, you can also run agents from anywhere - WhatsApp, Slack, keyboard shortcut, etc.

## How it works

You type a task into the command bar, hit enter, and an agent starts working in its own browser view. You can watch it work in real time, take over the browser to solve a captcha or log in, then hand control back.

### Views

- **Dashboard** — overview of all sessions with status summary
- **Grid** — tmux-style split panes (1x1, 2x2, 3x3 layouts) for watching agents work
- **List** — compact table with status, prompt, and elapsed time

### Vim keybindings

Navigation uses vim-style keys by default (`j`/`k` to move, `g g`/`G` for top/bottom, `c` to create, `x` to dismiss). All bindings are remappable in settings.

## Channels

Inbound message channels can trigger agent sessions automatically.

- **WhatsApp** — receives messages via WhatsApp Web bridge, routes them through ChannelRouter to create agent sessions

## Development

Requires [Task](https://taskfile.dev) (`brew install go-task`).

```bash
task up    # Install deps, build agent image, start the app
task       # See all commands
