# Agent Hub

A desktop app for running AI browser automation agents in isolated Chromium contexts. Each agent gets its own browser — separate cookies, storage, history — so they never interfere with each other or your personal Chrome session.

Built on Electron because browser automation agents need a real Chromium environment, not headless.

## How it works

You type a task into the command bar, hit enter, and an agent starts working in its own isolated browser. You can watch it work in real time, take over the browser to solve a captcha or log in, then hand control back.

### Session states

| State | Indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| draft | grey dot | Prompt entered, not submitted |
| running | green dot, pulsing | Agent executing |
| stuck | amber dot | No progress, needs attention |
| stopped | blue-grey dot | Finished or cancelled |

### Views

- **Dashboard** — overview of all sessions with status summary
- **Grid** — tmux-style split panes (1x1, 2x2, 3x3 layouts) for watching agents work
- **List** — compact table with status, prompt, and elapsed time

### Controls

- **Watch** — see the agent's browser in real time from the pane
- **Intervene** — take over the browser directly
- **Follow up** — send a follow-up prompt to a running or stopped session
- **Re-run** — copy a prompt and fire it again
- **Dismiss** — hide completed sessions from the grid without deleting data
- **Cancel** — stop a running agent

Sessions persist to SQLite so conversation history survives app restarts.

### Vim keybindings

Navigation uses vim-style keys by default (`j`/`k` to move, `g g`/`G` for top/bottom, `c` to create, `x` to dismiss). All bindings are remappable in settings.

## Channels

Inbound message channels can trigger agent sessions automatically.

- **WhatsApp** — receives messages via WhatsApp Web bridge, routes them through ChannelRouter to create agent sessions
