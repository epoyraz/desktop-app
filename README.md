## A desktop app for running browser agents 

Running automations on your local Chrome interferes with your daily work and also requires permissions every time. 

Browser Use Desktop allows you to port your cookies into a new Chromium environment and spawn tasks from anywhere on your computer with a keyboard shortcut. 

We use [Browser Use Harnessless](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness) as the agent framework.
