## A desktop app for running browser agents 

Running automations on local Chrome interferes with daily work and requires permissions every time. 

Browser Use Desktop allows you to port your cookies into a new Chromium environment and spawn tasks from anywhere on your computer with a keyboard shortcut. 

We use [Browser Harness](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness) as the agent framework.
