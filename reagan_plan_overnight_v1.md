# Overnight autonomous improvement loop — v1

**Start:** 2026-04-17 ~01:30 local (session resumed)
**Operator:** Claude Opus 4.7 (autonomous loop mode)
**User status:** asleep, authorized ~8h autonomous work
**Budget rules:**
- NEVER force-push, NEVER touch main
- NEVER commit .env or secrets
- ALWAYS run tests after code changes
- Commit at logical checkpoints
- File-based state > chat memory (this file is source of truth)

## Remaining work queue

### P1 — DONE (iter 6): pill-flow 6/6 green
Root cause was `await import('electron')` inside `electronApp.evaluate()` — ESM main process has no dynamic import. Fixed by using destructured `{ BrowserWindow }` from Playwright's evaluate first-arg. Commits: 9fdaf3f.

### P2 — DONE (iter 6): golden-path 7/7 green
Full scenario: fresh install → onboarding window → naming UI → OAuth bypass (account.json written directly) → relaunch → shell → pill → task_done mock → returning user relaunch → shell again. Commit: c13b324.
Production addition: `test:complete-onboarding` IPC in index.ts (NODE_ENV=test guard).

### P3 — Settings captures unblock (safe approach)
Do NOT override Vite `root` in vite.settings.config.ts (violates project memory). Instead, either:
- (a) Have capture.spec.ts shell out to `electron-forge start` via `spawn`, attach Playwright via remote debug port, then take screenshots. Heavier but respects the Forge build pipeline.
- (b) Write a separate `scripts/build-settings-renderer.ts` that invokes Forge's VitePlugin machinery directly to produce the expected output path.
- (c) Accept the gap and add docs noting settings screenshots captured manually.

### P4 — DONE (iter 8): Agent-task-wiki e2e GREEN
`tests/e2e/agent-task-wiki.spec.ts`: real agent task against a local wikipedia fixture page. Passed in 55.9s. Fixes applied: option (a) CDP port, daemon asyncio fix, _seq protocol echo, renderer path corrections, real agent_daemon binary built. Result: `PASS: page at bottom (scrollY=0, scrollHeight=72)`.

### P5 — Python pytest audit
`cd my-app/python && pytest` — report counts. Fix anything trivial (imports, deprecation warnings).

### P6 — Docs
- `my-app/README.md`: update to reflect new commands (`npm run dev:settings`, `npm run qa`, `npm run qa:review`)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: dev setup, test commands, how to regenerate baselines

### P7 — Onboarding polish validation
Run onboarding end-to-end in the app (requires `electron-forge start`). Verify mascot animations play correctly, wordmark renders, focus rings visible on Tab navigation. Capture screenshots if possible.

### P8 — Figma sync (when user wakes up)
The Figma OAuth URL was generated: user needs to visit it + paste callback. See iter 4 logs. Deferred.

---

## Blockers encountered

- **[02:00Z] Settings visual captures** — `SETTINGS_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` undefined in standalone Electron launch, `loadFile` path doesn't exist. iter 5 test-engineer attempted vite-root override fix but that violated the `project_electron_forge_vite_paths` memory rule and was reverted. See P3 above for safe approaches.
- **[02:00Z] onboarding-account-scopes capture** — Google OAuth opens external browser; needs mock. See P8.
- **[02:07Z] pill-flow e2e unskip** — iter 5 completed the refactor (MockDaemonClient, test:open-pill IPC, Menu accelerator trigger) but the spec has not been run against the real harness yet. See P1.
- **[02:41Z] Figma sync** — OAuth URL issued, user must visit + paste callback. See P8.
- **[03:11Z] agent-task-wiki CDP stall** — RESOLVED in iter 8. Applied option (a): `--remote-debugging-port=9223` + process.argv scan in discoverCdpPort. Also fixed: daemon asyncio event loop (Python 3.9 _shutdown_event in __init__), _seq echo for request/response correlation, renderer paths (.vite/build → .vite/renderer), pyinstaller.spec to build real agent_daemon.py. Spec GREEN: 1 passed (55.9s).

## Screenshots captured

`my-app/tests/visual/references/` (10 PNGs):
- onboarding-welcome, onboarding-naming, onboarding-account
- shell-empty, shell-3-tabs
- pill-idle, pill-streaming, pill-done, pill-error
- `manifest.json` (15 entries, 10 success)

## Decision log

- **Settings window size:** 720×560 fixed. Matches Track 5 spec.
- **API key masking:** `sk-ant-...XXXX` (first 7 + last 4). Never log full.
- **Factory reset in test env:** skips `app.relaunch()`.
- **.harness/, tests/visual/captures/, tests/visual/diff/:** gitignored (ephemeral).
- **vite.settings.config.ts root override:** REVERTED iter 5 — violated stored memory `project_electron_forge_vite_paths` ("NO root override").
- **setDaemonClient:** gated on `DAEMON_MOCK=1` env var (safety guard — never active in prod).
- **test:open-pill IPC:** gated on `DEV_MODE=1 || NODE_ENV=test` (never registered in prod builds).
- **Brand mascot animations:** BRAND.md-exact easings — idle 3s float, thinking 0.8s bounce, celebrating spring pop, error sharp shake.
- **Reduced-motion:** single global catch-all in theme.global.css AFTER specifics; no !important needed.
- **WCAG AA contrast:** fgTertiary lightened in both themes to pass 3:1 minimum.
- **Figma deferred:** OAuth can't be completed while user is asleep.

## iter 7 — Test Engineer session (2026-04-17)

### Task 1: Settings captures unblock (Option B — build-renderer helper)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED**

- `my-app/scripts/build-renderer.ts` written
  - Accepts `shell | pill | onboarding | settings`
  - Programmatic `viteBuild({ configFile, build: { outDir } })` — no `root:` override
  - Idempotent: skips if output HTML exists (pass `--force` to rebuild)
  - Exit 0 on success/already-built, Exit 1 on failure
- `.vite/renderer/settings/settings.html` **already exists** from iter 2
- `capture.spec.ts` `beforeAll` already skips pre-build when HTML is present
- The 5 settings capture tests (`settings-api-key`, `settings-agent`, `settings-appearance`, `settings-scopes`, `settings-danger-zone`) are already in `capture.spec.ts` — no new tests needed

**Capture success depends on:**
1. `main.js` registering a Settings menu item (so `Menu.getApplicationMenu()` returns it)
2. `SettingsWindow.ts` `loadFile` path resolving to `.vite/renderer/settings/settings.html`
3. The preload `settings.js` being in `.vite/build/`

### Task 2: axe-core accessibility audit

**Status: PLACEHOLDER (axe-core not in devDependencies)**

- `my-app/tests/a11y/axe-audit.spec.ts` written with `test.skip` placeholder
- Full real suite commented out inline, ready to activate
- `my-app/tests/a11y/reports/` directory created

**To unblock:**
```bash
cd my-app && npm install --save-dev axe-core
# Then un-comment the REAL SUITE section in axe-audit.spec.ts
```

### Task 3: Regression run

Vitest + Playwright to be run after commits.

## Next iteration (iter 6) plan

Delegate to parallel agents:
- **Agent A**: Run `npx playwright test tests/e2e/pill-flow.spec.ts` with proper env vars, fix any failures; write `golden-path.spec.ts`. 30 min budget.
- **Agent B**: Python pytest audit + README/CONTRIBUTING updates. 20 min budget.
- **Agent C** (optional): Approach P3 settings-captures via option (b) — build helper script. 30 min budget.

After agents complete:
- Aggregate reports
- Commit what's ready
- Update this file
- Schedule next wakeup (1500s heartbeat)
